            <h1>Curse of the Current Reviews</h1>
            <p>When you want to buy any application from the Apple iTunes store
                you have more choices than you can handle. Most fo the users scroll
                past the application description completely avoiding it like ads 
                displayed on the right column of your webpage. Their choice is dependent
                on three <b>important</b> factors: price, screenshot, and reviews.

            <h1>Introduction to Swift</h1>
            <p>Swift is a modern programming language developed by Apple to create 
                the next generation of iOS and OSX applications. Swift is a 
                fairly new language and still in development, but it clearly
                reflects the intentions and the future direction. This article
                will revolve around the basic concepts in the Swift language
                and how you can get started.
